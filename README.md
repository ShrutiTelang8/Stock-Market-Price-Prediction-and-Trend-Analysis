# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction-and-Trend-Analysis

The Stock Market does not follow any fixed model and is affected by several factors. So, an investor or trader needs to be watchful of the market behavior before investing in any stock. Financial traders and investors often face this problem as they donâ€™t understand which stocks to buy or sell to get optimal profits. The stock market data is available everywhere but analyzing all this information physically is not easy. The objective of our project is to investigate the trends and factors affecting the stock prices and then predict stock prices using data mining techniques. The purpose is to comparatively analyze the effectiveness of prediction algorithms on stock market data and get general insight on this data through visualization to predict future stock behavior and value at risk for each stock.
